class State:
    """
    Abstract base class representing a node in an extensive-form game tree.

    Player 0 is the MAX player; player 1 is the MIN player.
    Subclasses must override takeAction, isTerminal, getValue, and getActions.
    Evaluate and printState are optional but recommended for depth-limited search
    and debugging, respectively.

    In general, you may not change the takeAction, isTerminal, getValue, getActions functions.

    def __init__(self, Player=0):

        Initialize the state with the index of the player to move.

        Input  : Player (int) — 0 for the MAX player, 1 for the MIN player.
        Output : None
        Example: s = State(Player=0)  →  s.player == 0

        Return the successor state that results from applying action.

        Input  : action — an element of getActions(); its type is game-specific.
        Output : State  — a new State instance representing the next game position.
        Example: next_state = state.takeAction('call')  →  new PokerState after calling

        Return True if the game has ended at this state and no further moves exist.
